I have created the dashboard using Python Django as backend and React as frontent the setup for it is mentioned below

How to Set Up the App

Backend
If your PC doesn't have Python, download and install Python 3.12.4.
To install any dependencies in Python, use pip install <package-name>.
All packages are present in the virtual environment folder (venv).
Install Dependencies:

Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt using: pip install -r requirements.txt

To start the backend, activate the virtual environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate

Run the server: python manage.py runserver

Frontend
To set up the frontend, run: npm install

Note: You should have Node.js version 10.8.2 installed on your PC.

To start the client, run: npm start

With this setup, you should see the dashboard.

Thanks for the opportunity, Blackcoffer.
